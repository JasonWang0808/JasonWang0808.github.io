    <content type="text"><![CDATA[3. Longest Substring Without Repeating CharactersⅠ. DATA STRUCTURE: HashMap HashMap is a quick way to find elements in the time complexity of O(1) and is commonly used in leetcode. 1HashMap&lt;Charactor,Integer&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;&gt; (); Ⅱ. Method:Sliding WindowThe sliding window is an abstract concept commonly used in array/String problems. It likes Dynamic Programming, because we don’t know the answer until we finish it. The length is j - i because the arrange is [i, j) (left-closed, right-open). We set the ANS to record the longest answer. Once we find our next number is replucated in our map, we change the i to the number in our map, same with truncating. Then next, until we reach the end of the array. 1234567891011121314151617class Solution &#123; //map.put map.get map.containsKey public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) &#123; HashMap&lt;Character, Integer&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;&gt;(); int i = 0, j = 0, ans = 0; int l = s.length(); while(i &lt; l &amp;&amp; j &lt; l)&#123; if(map.containsKey(s.charAt(j)))&#123; //if next element in the map i = Math.max(map.get(s.charAt(j)) + 1, i); // abba, max is to prevent : "a" in the end makes i be '0' &#125; ans = Math.max(ans, j-i+1); // keep the bigger ans map.put(s.charAt(j), j); // refresh the map j ++; // goto next number &#125; return ans; &#125;&#125;]]></content>

Notes of the CS system and data structure from the class Notes of the Deep-learning courses from Udacity …. The reason why today is very important is that I realize that my blogs shouldn’t have been regarded as merely “records of my study”. It should be more formal, more beautiful, more ordered, and most importantly, more inspiring.I always like new beginings and new challanges, which make me feel alive. So I want to delve furture into some specific areas of study to equip myself to be more professional. Notes of how to deal with the problems on Leetcode Notes of deeper details of algorithm such as object detection Notes of new classes in new school ….. CLICK “About” to see my RESUME CLICK “Categories” to see all the topics of my articles CLICK “Tags”… OOPS, this is under building CLICK “Search” to find the topic you have interests on Hope you Enjoy this 1234567891011if (you have any questions)&#123; case email: wangjunyu0808@gmail.com; case insgram: wangjunyu0808; case wechat: HeNeArKrXnTn default;&#125;I will be happy to share ideas with you]]></content>
