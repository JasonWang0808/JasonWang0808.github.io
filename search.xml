    <content type="text"><![CDATA[RecursionFrom my perspective, Recursion is an efficient way because it makes us to only look at the current step. However, its complexity is very high. Example1. 10. Regular Expression Matching from Leetcode You can see the description on the above link. My problem is that it contains tooooo many different combination of “character”, “.” and “*“. It looks like a time array, which you should look at the moment. time before and the future, which is very bothering. So what we do here is only determine the current action, and let the function to judge what to do next itself. So, given two arries, we have several choices whether reach the end?12345678910# p and s reach the end at the same time# p reach the end, but s doesn'tdef isMatch(s, p)&#123; if(p.empty())&#123; if(s == empty()) return 1; else return 0 &#125;&#125;``` 2. if the first character match? def isMatch(s, p){ bool first_match; if(s[0] == p[0] || p[0] == ‘.’) first_match = true; }13. is it followed by * ? def isMatch(s, p){ if(p.length() &gt;= 2 || p[1] == ‘‘): # the second character of p is # this if means: * is 0 or not return isMatch(s, p.substr(2)) || (first_match &amp;&amp; isMatch(s.substr(1), p) else: return first_match &amp;&amp; isMatch(s.substr(1), p.substr(1)) }1The complete code in C++ #include using namespace std;class Solution {public: bool isMatch(string s, string p) { bool first = false; if(p.empty()){ return (s.empty()); } else{ first = (!s.empty() &amp;&amp; (s[0] == p[0] || p[0] == ‘.’)); } if(p.length()&gt;= 2 &amp;&amp; p[1] == ‘‘){ return (isMatch(s, p.substr(2)) || (first &amp;&amp; isMatch(s.substr(1), p) ) ); // make be 0 || make * be at least 1 } else return first &amp;&amp; isMatch(s.substr(1), p.substr(1)); }};int main() { Solution solution; return 0; }`We can see that the compexity is high. Because there are many duplicated calculations. SO we can set an array to solve this problem, this is same with DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING, which we will dicuss in there.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Dynamic ProgrammingThe situations are that our current situations depend on the old calculations. So we don’t need to start from the begining again, we can store the outcome of each step so we can cite it directly. Usually, the parameters of the function are the index instead of the object (string etc.) itself. Because our operations are on the matrix. Example1. 5. Longest Palindromic Substring from LeetcodeWe calculation according to the length of the string. If we wanna judge ‘cbbaac’, we can find whether ‘bbaa’ is Palindromic, then find the character from the two ends are same. Example2. 10. Regular Expression Matching from the LeetcodeJust like we talk in “Recursion”, DP algorithm sometimes help Recursion to decrease the calculation. Such as: 12345def dp(i, j, arr): if arr[i][j] != null: ## it can returns directly return arr[i][j] else: calculate the arr[i][j]]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[3. Longest Substring Without Repeating CharactersⅠ. DATA STRUCTURE: HashMap HashMap is a quick way to find elements in the time complexity of O(1) and is commonly used in leetcode. 1HashMap&lt;Charactor,Integer&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;&gt; (); Ⅱ. Method:Sliding WindowThe sliding window is an abstract concept commonly used in array/String problems. It likes Dynamic Programming, because we don’t know the answer until we finish it. The length is j - i because the arrange is [i, j) (left-closed, right-open). We set the ANS to record the longest answer. Once we find our next number is replucated in our map, we change the i to the number in our map, same with truncating. Then next, until we reach the end of the array. 1234567891011121314151617class Solution &#123; //map.put map.get map.containsKey public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) &#123; HashMap&lt;Character, Integer&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;&gt;(); int i = 0, j = 0, ans = 0; int l = s.length(); while(i &lt; l &amp;&amp; j &lt; l)&#123; if(map.containsKey(s.charAt(j)))&#123; //if next element in the map i = Math.max(map.get(s.charAt(j)) + 1, i); // abba, max is to prevent : "a" in the end makes i be '0' &#125; ans = Math.max(ans, j-i+1); // keep the bigger ans map.put(s.charAt(j), j); // refresh the map j ++; // goto next number &#125; return ans; &#125;&#125;]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Welcome to JunYu Wang’s siteI am proud that I’ve keep writing blogs for almost half year in 2018. The content are as followed. Notes of the CS system and data structure from the class Notes of the Deep-learning courses from Udacity …. The reason why today is very important is that I realize that my blogs shouldn’t have been regarded as merely “records of my study”. It should be more formal, more beautiful, more ordered, and most importantly, more inspiring.I always like new beginings and new challanges, which make me feel alive. So I want to delve furture into some specific areas of study to equip myself to be more professional. Notes of how to deal with the problems on Leetcode Notes of deeper details of algorithm such as object detection Notes of new classes in new school ….. CLICK “About” to see my RESUME CLICK “Categories” to see all the topics of my articles CLICK “Tags”… OOPS, this is under building CLICK “Search” to find the topic you have interests on Hope you Enjoy this 1234567891011if (you have any questions)&#123; case email: wangjunyu0808@gmail.com; case insgram: wangjunyu0808; case wechat: HeNeArKrXnTn default;&#125;I will be happy to share ideas with you]]></content>
